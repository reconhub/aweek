#' The aweek class
#'
#' The aweek class is a character or factor in the format YYYY-Www(-d) with a
#' "week_start" attribute containing an integer specifying which day of the ISO
#' 8601 week each week should begin. 
#'
#' @param x an object of class `aweek`
#' @param ... a series of `aweek` objects, characters, or Dates, (unused in `print.aweek()`)
#' @param recursive,use.names parameters passed on to [unlist()]
#'
#' @return an object of class `aweek`
#'
#' @details Weeks differ in their start dates depending on context. The ISO
#'   8601 standard specifies that Monday starts the week
#'   (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_week_date>) while the US CDC uses
#'   Sunday as the start of the week
#'   (<https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/22305>). For
#'   example, MSF has varying start dates depending on country in order to
#'   better coordinate response. 
#'
#'   While there are packages that provide conversion for ISOweeks and epiweeks,
#'   these do not provide seamless conversion from dates to epiweeks with 
#'   non-standard start dates. This package provides a lightweight utility to
#'   be able to convert each day.
#'
#'   \subsection{Calculation of week numbers}{
#'
#'   Week numbers are calculated in three steps:
#'
#'   1. Find the day of the week, relative to the week_start (d). The day of the
#'      week (d) relative to the week start (s) is calculated using the ISO week
#'      day (i) via `d = 1L + ((i + (7L - s)) %% 7L)`. 
#'   2. Find the date that represents midweek (m). The date that represents 
#'      midweek is found by subtracting the day of the week (d) from 4 and
#'      adding that number of days to the current date: `m = date + (4 - d)`.
#'   3. Find the week number (w) by counting the number of days since 1 January
#'      to (m), and use integer division by 7: `w = 1L + ((m - yyyy-01-01) %/% 7)`
#'
#'   For the weeks around 1 January, the year is determined by the week number.
#'   If the month is January, but the week number is 52 or 53, then the year for
#'   the week (YYYY) is the calendar year (yyyy) minus 1. However, if the month
#'   is December, but the week number is 1, then the year for the week (YYYY) is
#'   the calendar year (yyyy) plus 1.
#'
#'   }
#'   \subsection{Structure of the aweek object}{
#'   
#'   The aweek object is a character vector in either the precise ISO week
#'   format (YYYY-Www-d) or imprecise ISO week format (YYYY-Www) with 
#'   a `week_start` attribute indicating which ISO week day the week begins.
#'   The precise ISO week format can be broken down like this:
#'
#'    - **YYYY** is an ISO week-numbering year, which is the year relative to
#'      the week, not the day. For example, the date 2016-01-01 would be 
#'      represented as 2015-W53-5 (ISO week), because while the date is in the
#'      year 2016, the week is still part of the final week of 2015.
#'    - W**ww** is the week number, prefixed by the character "W". This ranges
#'      from 01 to 52 or 53, depending on whether or not the year has 52 or 53
#'      weeks.
#'    - **d** is a digit representing the weekday where 1 represents the first
#'      day of the week and 7 represents the last day of the week. #'
#'    The attribute `week_start` represents the first day of the week as an ISO
#'    week day. This defaults to 1, which is Monday. If, for example, an aweek
#'    object represented weeks starting on Friday, then the `week_start`
#'    attribute would be 5, which is Friday of the ISO week.
#'
#'   Imprecise formats (YYYY-Www) are equivalent to the first day of the week.
#'   For example, 2015-W53 and 2015-W53-1 will be identical when converted to
#'   date. 
#'
#'   }
#'
#' @note when combining aweek objects together, you must ensure that they have
#'   the same week_start attribute. You can use [change_week_start()] to adjust
#'   it.
