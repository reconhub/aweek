# Welcome to the *aweek* package\!

This package will convert dates to [US CDC
epiweeks](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/document/MMWR_Week_overview.pdf),
[isoweeks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_week_date), and all others
in between with minimal overhead. Other packages such as
[lubridate](https://github.com/tidyverse/lubridate),
[ISOweek](https://cran.r-project.org/package=ISOweek), and
[surveillance](http://surveillance.r-forge.r-project.org/) have the
ability to define ISOweeks and/or epiweeks have the ability to define
ISOweeks and/or epiweeks, the ability to easily switch between day and
week intervals is only available for ISOweeks. However, the ability to
easily switch between day and week intervals is only available for
ISOweeks and all of the packages above have dependencies that require
compiled code.

## Installing the package

To install the stable package version from CRAN, you can use

``` r
install.packages("aweek")
```

To benefit from the latest features and bug fixes, install the
development, *github* version of the package using:

``` r
remotes::install_github("reconhub/aweek")
```

Note that this requires the package *remotes* installed.

# Main Features

  - `date2week()` converts dates to a week format (YYYY-Www-d) that can
    start on any day.
  - `week2date()` / `as.Date()` does the backwards conversion from
    (YYYY-Www(-d)) to a numeric date.
  - Dependencies only on R itself.

onset

    ##          4         10          6

## Factors

You can also use it to automatically calculate factor levels, which is
useful in tabulating across weeks and including missing values.

``` r
set.seed(2019-02-26)
onset <- as.Date("2019-02-26") + sort(sample(-48:49, 20, replace = TRUE))
x <- date2week(onset, week_start = "sat", floor_day = TRUE, factor = TRUE)
x
```

    ## <aweek start: Saturday>
    ##  [1] 2019-W02 2019-W02 2019-W02 2019-W04 2019-W05 2019-W05 2019-W06
    ##  [8] 2019-W07 2019-W08 2019-W08 2019-W10 2019-W10 2019-W11 2019-W11
    ## [15] 2019-W13 2019-W13 2019-W14 2019-W14 2019-W14 2019-W16
    ## 15 Levels: 2019-W02 2019-W03 2019-W04 2019-W05 2019-W06 ... 2019-W16

``` r
table(x)
```

    ## x
    ## 2019-W02 2019-W03 2019-W04 2019-W05 2019-W06 2019-W07 2019-W08 2019-W09

    ## 2019-W10 2019-W11 2019-W12 2019-W13 2019-W14 2019-W15 2019-W16

## Locales

Itâ€™s also possible to specify the week\_start in terms of the current
locale, however it is important to be aware that code like this may not
be portable.

``` r
# workaround because of differing locale specifications
german <- if (grepl("darwin", R.version$os)) "de_DE.UTF-8" else "de_DE.utf8"
lct <- Sys.getlocale("LC_TIME")
res <- Sys.setlocale("LC_TIME", german)

date2week(as.Date("2019-02-26"), week_start = "Sonntag")
```

    ## <aweek start: Sonntag>
    ## [1] "2019-W09-3"

``` r
date2week(as.Date("2019-02-26"), week_start = "Sunday")
```

    ## <aweek start: Sonntag>
    ## [1] "2019-W09-3"

``` r
Sys.setlocale("LC_TIME", lct)
```

    ## [1] "en_GB.UTF-8"
